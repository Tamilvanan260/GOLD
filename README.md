## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **historical gold price trends** using advanced **machine learning regression models**.  
Gold, being one of the most valuable and stable commodities, is influenced by multiple economic indicators.  
The aim of this project is to **compare different regression models** and identify the best-performing one for accurate predictions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean gold price datasets (handling missing values, duplicates, scaling).
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends.
- Apply **feature selection** techniques (Mutual Information).
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Compare model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Provide insights into how economic factors (like USD to INR exchange rates) impact gold prices.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS Code  
- **Dataset Source:** Kaggle (Gold Price Historical Data)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

---

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Historical gold price data with attributes like USD to INR, Average Gold Price per gram, and Gold Price per 10g in INR.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, duplicates, outliers, and feature scaling.  
3. **Feature Selection** – Mutual Information used to select most relevant predictors.  
4. **Model Training** – Training different regression algorithms.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) for performance comparison.  
6. **Visualization** – Heatmaps, histograms, bar plots, and error analysis.

## 📊 Results
| Model                     | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | Remarks |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Linear Regression          | 48.72                   | Struggled with non-linear data |
| Decision Tree Regressor    | 28.65                   | Good for non-linear, but overfitting |
| Random Forest Regressor    | 19.34                   | Balanced accuracy |
| **Gradient Boosting** ✅    | **17.84**               | Best-performing model |
| Support Vector Regressor   | 29.87                   | Sensitive to hyperparameters |

➡️ **Gradient Boosting Regressor** emerged as the most effective model with the lowest error.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Include additional features like stock indices, oil prices, and geopolitical factors.  
- Apply **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** for time-series forecasting.  
- Use **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize models.  
- Expand dataset with global market data for broader predictions.
